# Contributing to Multi Dimensional Configuration

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [issue/bug reports](#issuebug-reports), [feature requests](#feature-requests), [questions](#questions) and submitting [pull requests](#pull-requests).

## Issue/bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for issue/bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` branch in the repository

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Questions

We're always open to a new conversations. So if you have any questions just ask us.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Guidelines for pull requests:

1. Add issue first or choose existing
2. Create a new branch
3. Assign issue to branch
4. Make your changes. Use similar coding style. Please note that your PR should include tests for the new codebase!
5. Push to your code and submit a pull request to `master` branch
